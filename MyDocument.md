**Analyzing this dataset can provide valuable insights into the job market in New York City and help identify trends and patterns in the job postings.***

# Learnings:

    1. Minimum qual requirements, and preferred skills are the two most important features to analyze as they provide insights into the job requirements and responsibilities.
    2. The job postings dataset is highly imbalanced, with certain job categories having significantly more job postings than others.
    3. The dataset contains job postings from a diverse range of industries, including healthcare, logistics, manufacturing, education, finance, and technology.
    4. The total number of dataset is 2,947 job postings 
    5. The dataset can help identify the most popular Business titles, recruiting agency with the most job postings, and the most sought-after or preferred skills and academic qualifications.

# Challenges:

    1.  The job titles and descriptions can be quite complex and varied, which makes it challenging to group them into categories.
    2.  The dataset only covers a limited time period (between 2011 and 2019). Hence, the job market in New York City may have changed  significantly since then.
    3.  Data quality issues, such as missing values or inconsistent formatting, could impact the accuracy of the analysis. Hence, data cleaning and preprocessing, checking for duplicates or errors, and dealing with missing values should be done for accurate data insights.
    4.  Dealing with outliers, such as extremely high or low salaries, which could skew the analysis.
    5.  The dataset does not provide information about the candidates who applied for the jobs, which could limit the ability to understand the job market from a job seeker's perspective.

# Considerations:

    -  The dataset contains information on job postings, not necessarily on job hires, which means that some job postings may not have resulted in a hire.
    2.  The salary information in the dataset may not be accurate, as it is often listed as a range and may not reflect the actual salary offered.
    3.  The dataset contains information only for the year between 2011 and 2019, and may not be representative of the job market in other years.

    1.  Data collection method: Was the data collected through surveys, job postings, or administrative records? This can affect the representativeness of the dataset.
    Data quality: How complete and accurate is the data? Are there missing values, outliers, or errors that need to be addressed?
    Variables included: What variables are included in the dataset, and do they accurately reflect the job market in New York City?
    Timeframe: What time period does the data cover, and is it up-to-date and relevant to current labor market conditions?
    Bias: Is the dataset representative of the diversity of New York City's job market, or does it have any biases or limitations in its coverage?

# Assumptions:

    1.  The job postings are a accurate reflection and representative of the actual job responsibilities of the job market demand in New York City, with minimal errors or omissions.
    2.  The variables included in the dataset are relevant and informative for understanding the job market in New York City.
    3.  There are no significant biases in the data collection or reporting that would skew the results.
    4.  The salary ranges provided in the dataset are a good approximation of the actual salary offered.
